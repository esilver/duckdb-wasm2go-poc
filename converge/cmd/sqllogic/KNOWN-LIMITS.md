# Known limitations — pure-Go DuckDB engine (sqllogictest corpus)

Canonical root-cause analysis of every file still failing the upstream DuckDB
sqllogictest corpus.

> **Current canonical baseline (2026-06-10, tail sweep #2):
> 2,522 PASS / 9 FAIL / 791 SKIP — 99.6 % pass rate excluding skips**
> (`/tmp/sqllogic_tail2_final.txt`). Every one of the 9 remaining failures is
> a documented PERMANENT EXCLUSION (see the tail-sweep-#2 section below) —
> the corpus is **done**: nothing left is believed fixable without changing
> the build's environmental constraints (single-threaded wasm32, statically
> linked ICU/json) or the upstream test itself. The dated sections below are
> the chronological fix log (2,309 → 2,489 → 2,493 → 2,502 → 2,505 → 2,513 →
> 2,522).

> **2026-06-12 rerun:** the standalone runner in this directory, using
> `github.com/esilver/duckdb-go-pure v0.3.11`, reproduced the same baseline over
> DuckDB v1.5.3 `test/sql/**`: 3,322 files, 2,522 PASS / 9 FAIL / 791 SKIP,

**2026-06-10 corpus tail sweep #2 — all 20 remaining failures classified to
ground truth; 10 fixed, 1 converted to an upstream-parity SKIP, 9 declared
PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS.** Every file was re-run in isolation and compared
against the official native DuckDB v1.5.3 CLI (same commit 14eca11 as
`duckdb-src`). The translated ENGINE was wrong ZERO times — the running
exoneration tally (bind_varchar, set-seed/IEJoin, tx-abort, stats-overflow
catch dispatch, checkpoint-FATAL, WAL APPEND, …) now includes the rowsort
bool rendering and `reset label` below; the engine has still never been wrong.

Runner fixes (converge/cmd/sqllogic):

- **`predicate_factoring` — runner rowsort/hash bool rendering.** The runner
  rendered top-level BOOLEAN cells as "true"/"false"; upstream's runner
  converts them to "1"/"0" (result_helper.cpp `SQLLogicTestConvertValue`)
  BEFORE rowsort/valuesort ordering and md5 hashing. `rowsort` over a
  BOOLEAN column with NULLs therefore sorted differently than the expected
  block ("NULL" < "false" but "0" < "NULL"), producing position mismatches.
  The engine's `(a=1 AND b>3) OR (a=1 AND c<5)` evaluation is correct and
  was never factoring-buggy (probes match native row-for-row, with and
  without `enable_verification`). The "engine correctness bug" recorded in
  the R-table below is RETRACTED.
- **`test_loosely_qualified_view_sql` — runner ignored `reset label`.** The
  file reuses one hash label across `foreach` iterations with different view
  bodies, resetting it between iterations; our parser dropped `reset label`
  (lumped into ignored directives), so iteration 2 compared against
  iteration 1's stored hash. The engine's loosely-qualified view SQL
  requalification is CORRECT (all three view variants probe identical to
  native). The R-table entry is RETRACTED.
- **`errors_as_json` + `error_position` — runner unwrapped the engine's
  INTENDED JSON errors.** The engine implements `SET errors_as_json=true`
  correctly (ClientContext::ProcessError → ConvertErrorToJSON; verified
  byte-equivalent to native). The runner's `decodeEngineError` decoded ANY
  JSON-shaped error text back to "<Type> Error: <msg>" — needed historically
  because the DRIVER's host-side fallback surfaces the raw C++ throw payload
  (DuckDB exceptions carry transport JSON in `what()`). The decode now lives
  in the DRIVER's fallback path only (`converge/duckdb/errjson.go`, applied
  in `module.lastError`), so the runner sees exactly what a native client
  sees: plain text normally, the intended JSON under errors_as_json.
- **`test_icu_calendar` — runner Indian-calendar rendering.** The one failing
  record renders a TIMESTAMPTZ under `SET CALENDAR='indian'`; the engine's
  micros are EXACTLY native (epoch_us probe). The runner now ports ICU's
  IndianCalendar (civil Saka over proleptic Gregorian,
  icu indiancalendar.cpp handleComputeFields) for date rendering when the
  session calendar is 'indian'; other non-default calendars keep the hybrid
  Julian/Gregorian rendering.
- **`test_sample_too_big` — `require ram 16gb` now SKIPs (upstream parity).**
  Upstream's runner skips when `FileSystem::GetAvailableMemory()` is below
  the requirement; this runner caps DuckDB at 512MB, so `require ram` above
  that cap is MISSING → SKIP, exactly like upstream on a small machine.
  (`array_large.test`, `require ram 8gb`, moves PASS → SKIP for the same
  honest reason; it only passed at 512MB because its requirement is
  conservative.)

Driver fixes (converge/duckdb):

- **`test_json_serialize_plan` — JSON result cells now arrive RAW.** The
  driver parsed JSON result columns into Go maps (duckdb-go semantics),
  losing OBJECT KEY ORDER; the test's
  `<REGEX>:.*LOGICAL_PROJECTION.*LOGICAL_GET.*` is order-sensitive (sorted
  keys put `children` before `type`). JSON cells are now delivered as
  `duckdb.JSONValue` raw text — exactly DuckDB's VARCHAR rendering of JSON —
  and the runner compares raw text (with a structural-equality fallback for
  whitespace differences). The serialized plan itself was always correct
  (all LOGICAL_* names present).
- **`test_make_get_type` — TYPE result decode.** `LogicalTypeId::TYPE` (the
  results of `get_type`/`make_type`) has no C-API mapping
  (`DUCKDB_TYPE_INVALID`); cells are VARCHAR-physical blobs holding a
  BinarySerializer-encoded LogicalType. The driver now decodes the blob and
  renders `LogicalType::ToString()` (`converge/duckdb/typedecode.go`: LEB128
  varints, uint16 field ids, 0xFFFF object terminators; plain ids +
  STRUCT/LIST/MAP/ARRAY/DECIMAL infos + alias; `SQLNULL` renders `"NULL"`
  quoted, like types.cpp:508).

Host-FS C++ fixes (host_fs.cpp, landed with this sweep's wasm rebuild):

- **`read_csv_glob` — `file_search_path` was ignored by HostFileSystem::Glob**
  (the resolution lives in LocalFileSystem, local_file_system.cpp:1738, which
  we replace). Globs on relative paths now seed the expansion queue with the
  comma-separated search paths (cwd only when unset), and the non-glob /
  last-ditch lookups try the search-path joins (FetchFileWithoutGlob port).
- **`logging_csv` + `logging_types` — FileSystem TRACE ops were never
  logged.** Native logs OPEN/READ/WRITE/CLOSE from inside LocalFileSystem
  via `FileHandle::TryAddLogger` + the `DUCKDB_LOG_FILE_SYSTEM_*` macros;
  HostFileSystem replaced those methods without the hooks, so
  `duckdb_logs_parsed('FileSystem')` was always empty (and the CSV log file
  sniffed wrong column types from the empty/warning-only content). The same
  macros now fire in HostFileSystem's OpenFile/Read/Write/Close (positions
  logged exactly like local_file_system.cpp). [The earlier WAL-APPEND fix
  was necessary but unrelated — log_storage.cpp's APPEND open was a red
  herring; the missing piece was the logging hooks themselves.]

**PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS — the 9 remaining failures, each justified:**

| File | Justification (all verified against the official v1.5.3 CLI, same commit as duckdb-src) |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test/sql/aggregate/aggregates/test_quantile_disc.test` | **Upstream test bug at this tag.** Expects `1.2` from `quantile_disc(x, 0.8 ORDER BY x DESC)` over `(2),(1)`; the OFFICIAL v1.5.3 binary returns `1` (int32 — `1.2` is not even representable in the result type), bit-identical to us, in every variant (DESC modifier, negative quantile, optimizer off). The expectation matches a different (newer) development behavior. |
| `test/sql/catalog/test_extension_suggestion.test` | **Static json extension (native parity).** Expects `from_json` to be "not in the catalog, but it exists in the json extension"; json is statically registered in this build — and the official CLI emits the IDENTICAL `Binder Error: No function matches…` we do. The test requires a no-autoload dynamic-extension environment. |
| `test/sql/copy/csv/rejects/csv_rejects_read.test` | **Static ICU (native parity).** The dr_who.csv rejects probe expects 5 CAST rejects; with ICU loaded the TIMESTAMPTZ/TIMETZ column errors do not produce reject rows — the official CLI also logs exactly the 3 we log (date/time/timestamp). |
| `test/sql/copy/csv/test_timestamptz_12926.test` | **Static ICU (native parity).** Expects `read_csv(dtypes=[TIMESTAMPTZ])` to reject `1/1/2020`; with ICU loaded the conversion SUCCEEDS — official CLI succeeds identically. |
| `test/sql/function/generic/test_sleep.test` | **Single-threaded build.** `sleep_ms` raises "requires DuckDB to be compiled with thread support" — wasm build has no threads, by design. |
| `test/sql/json/issues/read_json_memory_usage.test` | **Single-threaded build (native parity).** The expected OOM needs `SET threads=8` × per-thread JSON buffers to exceed 50MiB; native v1.5.3 with `threads=1` SUCCEEDS at 50MiB exactly like us (probe: count=5). Our build is permanently 1 thread. |
| `test/sql/limit/test_batch_limit_filters.test` | **Single-threaded build (native parity).** Expects the batched LIMIT (no STREAMING_LIMIT); native v1.5.3 with `SET threads=1` also plans `STREAMING_LIMIT`. Plan shape is a thread-count consequence, not an engine defect. |
| `test/sql/timezone/disable_timestamptz_casts.test` | **Static ICU.** The test asserts the setting "has no effect when ICU is not loaded"; ICU is statically linked (mirroring the cgo libduckdb), so the disabled-cast Binder Error correctly fires. |
| `test/sql/types/timestamp/test_timestamp_tz.test` | **Static ICU.** Expects `TIMESTAMPTZ::DATE` to error without ICU; with ICU linked the cast correctly succeeds. |

The first two ICU entries (and the json one) are not "wontfix because hard":
the official native binary the corpus ships against behaves byte-identically
to this build; the tests only pass under upstream's no-extension unittest
configuration, which a statically-linked build cannot (and should not)
emulate.

> Historical note — the previous canonical baseline (2026-06-10 morning,
> post wasm-rebuild #1) was 2,513 PASS / 20 FAIL / 789 SKIP
> (`/tmp/sqllogic_wasmrebuild.txt`); the itemized "remaining files" list
> below marks the 8 files that rebuild struck from the 28.

**Provenance.** Corpus: `duckdb-src/test/sql` — 3,322 `.test` files
(`.test_slow` excluded). Runner: `converge/cmd/sqllogic` (binary snapshot
`/tmp/slt-salvage`), executed with cwd = `duckdb-src`, 30 s/file timeout.
Baseline report: `/tmp/sqllogic_salvage.txt` (2026-06-09):

| | files | % of executed |
|---|---|---|
| PASS | 2,309 | 69.5 % |
| FAIL | **224** | 6.7 % |
| SKIP (unsupported directives: `load`, `require parquet/tpch/httpfs/...`) | 789 | 23.8 % |
| **Pass rate excluding skips** | | **91.2 %** |

**2026-06-10 tail-sweep update.** The nested-fidelity lane took the corpus to
2,443 PASS / 90 FAIL; this lane re-classified all 90 and fixed the
runner/driver-side classes. New baseline (`/tmp/sqllogic_tail_final.txt`):
**2,489 PASS / 44 FAIL / 789 SKIP — 98.3 % pass rate excluding skips**; the
44 still-failing files are a strict subset of the previous 90 (zero new
failures) and all engine-side:

- **P (runner limitations) — FIXED.** Expected rows now split like upstream's
  `StringUtil::Split(line, "\t")` (empty fields dropped, applied only as a
  fallback when the strict split disagrees with the column count), and
  multi-variable `foreach type,min,max tok,tok,tok` iterates correctly. All 16
  P files plus `read_json_dates` (the third multi-var foreach user) pass.
- **D (BIGNUM decode) — FIXED** in the driver (`exotic.go bignumString`):
  varint blob → exact decimal string. All bignum files pass.
- **E (VARIANT decode) — FIXED** in the driver (`variant.go`): full binary
  decode of the physical 4-child struct; cells deliver the exact
  `Value::CastAs(VARCHAR)` string (ARRAY items raw, OBJECT values
  quoted-if-needed). The runner renders VARIANT children raw at nested
  positions (`faceVariant`). All variant files pass.
- **F (GEOMETRY decode) — FIXED** in the driver (`exotic.go geometryString`):
  WKB → WKT port of `Geometry::ToStringRecursive` (Z/M flags, EMPTY parts,
  fmt-style coordinates). All geo files pass.
- **G (UUID-as-INT128) — FIXED** in the driver: UUID cells render canonically
  (`BaseUUID::ToString` MSB flip) on every path (flat, nested, UDF args).
- **L (host-FS gaps) — PARTIAL.** `__syscall_getcwd` is now implemented in
  wasishim (fixes "Could not get working directory!");
  `allowed_directories_install` progresses to an extension-directory
  resolution gap (`Cannot access directory ""`). The remaining L items live in
  the C++ `host_fs.cpp` compiled into the wasm (a rebuild, not driver work):
  `~` expansion ignores the `home_directory` setting (opener not plumbed),
  `file://` URLs unsupported (attach_fsspec), persistent secrets hit the
  stubbed emscripten `__syscall_mkdirat`/`stat64` family,
  `disabled_filesystems`/local-FS-metadata are not enforced against
  HostFileSystem.
- **C (temporal) — `test_icu_timezone` FIXED** (runner now accepts
  `UTC±HH[:MM]` fixed-offset TimeZone spellings and renders pre-1582
  TIMESTAMPTZ dates with ICU's hybrid Julian/Gregorian calendar).
  `test_icu_calendar` remains: rendering under non-Gregorian SESSION CALENDARS
  (`SET Calendar='indian'/'islamic-umalqura'`) would require reimplementing
  those ICU calendars in the runner; the japanese (hybrid) rows now match.


**2026-06-10 wasm rebuild (host-FS + WAL APPEND).** Full pipeline re-run (first
from-scratch since splitter steps 4c/4d) with host_fs.cpp + wasishim fixes:
`~` expansion via ExpandPath+CanonicalizePath, `file://` URLs, HostFileSystem
installed as VFS default (persistent secrets), GetName()="LocalFileSystem"
(disabled_filesystems enforcement), HOME-only WASI environ
(allowed_directories_install), lstat64/stat64/mkdirat in wasishim, and the
checkpoint-lane FILE_FLAGS_APPEND fix (WAL head no longer overwritten).
New baseline (`/tmp/sqllogic_wasmrebuild.txt`): **2,513 PASS / 20 FAIL / 789
SKIP — 99.2% excluding skips**; 8 files fixed (all of class L host-FS +
wal_promote_version), zero new failures. The logging pair (class M) did NOT
flip — APPEND was necessary but not sufficient there; still open.

**2026-06-10 `set seed` fix.** The "IEJoin nondeterministic wrong results"
(bucket R's headline correctness bug) and all of bucket Q were OUR RUNNER, not
the engine: the parser lumped `set` into the ignored directives, so
`set seed <v>` was silently dropped and `random()` ran unseeded — wrong,
flickering data in every seed-dependent test. DuckDB's runner translates the
directive to `SELECT SETSEED(<v>)` (`sqllogic_test_runner.cpp:1016`); ours now
does the same. The engine's RNG is bit-identical to native after SETSEED
(probe reproduces upstream's exact `252652/29774/17657/…` row, 3/3 runs;
the two iejoin files 50/50 green in a loop at `-j 1` and `-j 4`). Fixes 4
files: `iejoin_projection_maps`, `test_iejoin_events` (R — there is NO IEJoin
engine bug), `set_seed_for_sample`, `test_volatile_independence` (all of Q).
New baseline: **2,493 PASS / 40 FAIL**.

Everything else still failing is engine-side and keeps its classification
below (I, J, K remnants, N, O, R singles, A remnants:
`read_csv_glob` relative `glob('*/*.csv')` count and `csv_rejects_read`
rejects-table row count, plus M remnants logging_csv/logging_types).

**2026-06-10 tx-abort + stats-overflow fixes (classes I and J — both OUR
GLUE, not the engine).**

- **I (explicit-tx aborted state) — FIXED, was the RUNNER.** The three
  `multistatement_is_transactional_chained_*` files send
  `BEGIN TRANSACTION; <failing stmt>` as ONE record. The runner's `inTxn`
  tracking only looked at the prefix of the whole record text and only on
  overall success, so the BEGIN that succeeded as a split part went
  unrecorded; the record's expected error then triggered the sacrificial
  `ROLLBACK`, destroying the very transaction the next record expects to be
  aborted ("Current transaction is aborted (please ROLLBACK)"). The engine's
  aborted-state semantics are CORRECT — the sibling file
  `multistatement_is_transactional_after_BEGIN.test` (same scenario, BEGIN as
  its own record) always passed. Fix: track tx state per executed part
  (`trackTxn`) in both `execStatement` and `execQuery`. All 3 files pass.
- **J (stats max−min overflow) — FIXED in exhost (catch-dispatch id
  collision), the engine C++ was right all along.** Native v1.5.3 runs the
  same statements clean. The overflow is REAL but INTERNAL:
  `CompressedMaterialization::GetIntegralRangeValue` evaluates
  `stats_max - stats_min` through `ExpressionExecutor::TryEvaluateScalar`,
  whose landing pad is `catch (InternalException &) { throw; }
  catch (...) { return false; }` — natively the OutOfRangeException is
  swallowed and compression is skipped. In exhost, `typeID(0)` (the
  catch-all) returned the reserved id 1 while `nextType` ALSO started at 1,
  so the first real typeinfo (InternalException) shared id 1: the catch-all
  match published an id equal to `llvm_eh_typeid_for(InternalException)`,
  the pad entered the typed clause and RETHREW. Every query whose column
  stats spanned more than the type's range (ORDER BY / GROUP BY / LAG over
  ±extreme columns) surfaced "Out of Range Error: Overflow in subtraction"
  (or, under the tests' own `PRAGMA enable_verification`, the wrapper
  "Unoptimized statement differs from original result!" — verification is
  test-enabled, not a build flag of ours). Fix: real type ids start at 2
  (`exhost/host.go`); regression `duckdb/statsoverflow_test.go`. Fixes
  `test_null_aggregates`, `hugeint_order_by_extremes`, `test_lead_lag` (and
  J's historical siblings `group_by_limits`, `test_leadlag_orderby`). Any
  other `catch (T) {...} catch (...) {...}` pad whose first-registered typed
  candidate collided with id 1 was equally exposed; the same fix flipped
  THREE more files: `test_in_empty_table` and `test_in_rewrite_rule` (the
  "IN-list eagerly casts VARCHAR literals to INT32 and errors" R-class entry —
  the binder's try-cast fallback is a catch(...) pad; native-matching empty
  result now) and `map_from_entries/data_types` (K, error-shape now matches).

New baseline: **2,502 PASS / 31 FAIL / 789 SKIP — 98.8 % pass rate excluding
skips** (`/tmp/sqllogic_txstats_full.txt`); 9 files flipped, zero new
failures vs the 2,493/40 baseline.

Running tally of "engine bugs" that were really glue/harness: bind_varchar,
set-seed/IEJoin, tx-abort (runner), stats max−min overflow (exhost catch
dispatch). The translated engine has not yet been wrong.

**2026-06-10 checkpoint/WAL sweep (class N: 3 runner fixes + 1 root-caused
host-FS C++ bug — translated engine exonerated again).**

- **N (checkpoint-FATAL trio) — FIXED, was the RUNNER.** The three checkpoint
  fault-injection files (`test_checkpoint_failure_on_detach` /
  `_delayed_commit` / `_delayed_rollback`) EXPECT the fatal:
  `statement error … Checkpoint aborted before header write because of PRAGMA
  checkpoint_abort flag`. Our engine throws the byte-identical
  `FATAL Error: Detached database '…', but CHECKPOINT during DETACH failed …`
  that native v1.5.3 throws (verified CLI side-by-side; the database is
  invalidated afterwards on BOTH sides), but the runner's `isInternalError`
  pre-check classified ANY "FATAL Error" as an automatic INTERNAL/fatal
  failure BEFORE the expected-error match ran. DuckDB's own runner matches
  `statement error` by plain substring with no FATAL/INTERNAL carve-out
  (`test/sqlite/result_helper.cpp:311-316`). Fix (`execStatement`): a
  FATAL/INTERNAL error that an `error`/`maybe` record expects (non-empty
  pattern that matches) flows into normal expectation matching. The engine's
  checkpoint-failure semantics — including `debug_checkpoint_abort` fault
  injection — are CORRECT.
- **N (`wal_promote_version`) — ROOT-CAUSED: hand-written C++ host-FS glue
  (`host_fs.cpp`), pending wasm rebuild.** `HostFileSystem::OpenFile` drops
  `FILE_FLAGS_APPEND`. Native maps the flag to `O_APPEND`
  (`local_file_system.cpp:347`) and the WAL relies on it
  (`WriteAheadLog::Initialize` opens APPEND; `BufferedFileWriter` writes via
  the position-form `Write`). Our `HostFileHandle` starts `position = 0`, so
  appending to an EXISTING WAL on re-attach (checkpoint-on-shutdown disabled,
  STORAGE_VERSION promotion) silently OVERWRITES the WAL head in place: the
  WAL stays 275 bytes (native grows 275 → 383) with the cycle-1
  use_table/insert/flush entries written over the CREATE TABLE entry, and the
  next replay finds no table → `Catalog Error: Table with name T does not
  exist!` (byte-level hexdump proof; cycle-0 WAL+db are byte-identical to
  native). Fix is one hunk — initialize the handle position to the file size
  when `flags.OpenForAppending()` (`BufferedFileWriter::Truncate` already
  re-Seeks, so WAL truncation composes) — handed to the wasm-rebuild lane:
  `/tmp/checkpoint/host_fs_append.patch`. Regression test
  `converge/duckdb/walpromote_repro_test.go` (skips until the rebuild lands;
  run with `WALREPRO=1`). The `log_storage.cpp` APPEND open suggests part of
  class M shares this cause.

New baseline: **2,505 PASS / 28 FAIL / 789 SKIP — 98.9 % pass rate excluding
skips** (`/tmp/sqllogic_checkpoint_full.txt`); the 28 are a strict subset of
the 31 (zero new failures). Tally: checkpoint-FATAL was the runner; the WAL
append bug is OUR hand-written host-FS shim — the TRANSLATED engine C++ has
still never been wrong.

**The remaining files** (first-failure symptom; the three checkpoint-FATAL
files struck by the N fix above are removed; the 8 entries marked
~~struck~~ were fixed by the 2026-06-10 wasm rebuild, leaving **20**):

Every one of the 224 failing files was re-run and classified for this document
(verbose rerun 2026-06-09, reproduced 224/224; two extra files appeared only
under `-j 4` load and are listed under "Flaky" at the end). Classification is
by the file's *first* failing record; many files additionally contain later
records that would hit other buckets.

**Reading the fixability column**

- `runner` — false failure; the engine is right (or right enough), the test
  harness is too strict. Fix in `converge/cmd/sqllogic`.
- `driver` — fixable in the Go driver / result-decode / host layer
  (`converge/duckdb`, `converge/exhost`) without touching the engine.
- `engine` — needs a change in the translated engine (genpkg) or a wasm
  rebuild with patched C++.
- `in-flight` — a fix is already being worked in parallel.
- `wontfix` — intentional divergence of this build (documented, not planned).

| # | Bucket | Files | Root cause | Fixability | Example |
|---|--------|------:|------------|------------|---------|
| A | FS glob / multi-file path resolution | 43 | `HostFileSystem` glob never matches: `read_csv('…/*.csv')`, `glob()`, directory-as-glob, `[ab]`/`?` patterns and multi-file readers all return "No files found that match the pattern" (or 0 rows from `glob()`), and two error-message tests fail only because the glob errors first. | driver (**in-flight**) | `test/sql/copy/csv/glob/read_csv_glob.test` |
| B | Nested-value rendering fidelity | 46 | Driver-side stringification of LIST/STRUCT/MAP differs from DuckDB's VARCHAR cast: strings inside nested values are not single-quoted (`[utm_source=]` vs `['utm_source=']`), embedded quotes are doubled instead of backslash-escaped (`'''hello'''` vs `'\'hello\''`), unnamed structs render `{'': 1}` instead of `(1)`, FLOAT renders with double precision (`0.8999999761581421` vs `0.9`), DOUBLE renders scientific (`-6.3517824e+10` vs `-63517824000.0`), TIME/TIMESTAMP inside nested values render as bare/`1970-01-01`-prefixed/date-only values. | driver | `test/sql/cast/string_to_list_cast.test` |
| C | Temporal decode: range wrap, precision, TZ offset | 25 | Scalar TIME/TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ decode goes through Go `time.Time` nanoseconds: timestamps outside ±292 years of 1970 wrap (BC dates and `290309-12-22 (BC)` come back as 1696–2262 garbage), `TIMESTAMP_NS`/`%n`/`TIMESTAMP(7)`/`TIME_NS` are truncated to µs, TIMESTAMPTZ renders as UTC with no `±HH` offset, `TIME '24:00:00'` renders as `1970-01-02`. | driver | `test/sql/types/timestamp/timestamp_limits.test` |
| D | BIGNUM decode | 10 | Every `BIGNUM` (varint) value decodes to `NULL` in the result path; engine-side arithmetic itself is exercised but nothing survives decode. | driver | `test/sql/types/bignum/test_bignum_sum.test` |
| E | VARIANT decode | 6 | `VARIANT` values decode to `NULL` (top-level, inside lists, after storage round-trip, and from `variant_extract`). | driver | `test/sql/types/variant/json_cast.test` |
| F | GEOMETRY decode | 6 | `GEOMETRY` values decode to `NULL` (`POINT (1 2)` expected); includes WKB round-trip hash mismatch and the v1.4.3 storage-compat file. | driver | `test/sql/types/geo/geometry_crs.test` |
| G | UUID-as-INT128 paths | 4 | On some paths (JSON→UUID cast, BLOB→UUID try_cast, UUID through window/unnest) UUID values render as the raw HUGEINT (`-170141183…`) instead of `00000000-…`. | driver | `test/sql/types/uuid/test_uuid_cast.test` |
| H | PIVOT multi-statement prepare | 12 | Top-level `PIVOT` without an explicit IN-list expands (inside DuckDB) into multiple statements; the driver's prepare path rejects it: "Cannot prepare multiple statements at once!". | driver | `test/sql/pivot/top_level_pivot_syntax.test` |
| I | Explicit-tx aborted-state semantics | 3 | After an error inside `BEGIN; <failing stmt>` the transaction must enter the aborted state ("Current transaction is aborted (please ROLLBACK)"); ours lets the next query succeed. | engine | `test/sql/transactions/statement-preprocessor/multistatement_is_transactional_chained_BEGIN.test` |
| J | Stats-range `max − min` overflow | 5 | A shared statistics-range computation does unchecked `max - min`: full-range INT16/INT64/INT128 columns abort GROUP BY, ORDER BY (hugeint radix) and LAG/LEAD with "Out of Range Error: Overflow in subtraction of INT16 (32767 - -32768)!". | engine | `test/sql/aggregate/group/group_by_limits.test` |
| K | Error-text fidelity tail | 7 | Right rejection, wrong message/shape: prepared-parameter count text, missing "exists in the json extension" suggestion, `errors_as_json` MISSING_ENTRY type, error `position` field, error-precedence (duplicate-map-key fires before catalog "already exists"). | engine | `test/sql/catalog/table/create_table_parameters.test` |
| L | Host-FS / sandbox environment gaps | 7 | `~` not expanded, `file://` URLs unsupported, `getcwd` unimplemented, `mkdir .duckdb` unimplemented (persistent secrets), `SET disabled_filesystems`/local-FS-metadata not enforced against HostFileSystem. Also a real driver bug: HostFileSystem errors print literal placeholders — `failed to open "{}" (errno {})`. | driver | `test/sql/attach/attach_home_directory.test` |
| M | Logging subsystem parity | 5 | `current_query_id()` returns `UINT64_MAX` (then `+1` overflows), `duckdb_logs` contains extra QueryLog rows, FileSystem TRACE ops are never logged (host FS bypasses the engine logger), logged-CSV column types differ. | driver+engine | `test/sql/logging/logging_context_ids.test` |
| N | Checkpoint/WAL deep storage semantics | 4 | ~~Delayed CHECKPOINT after DETACH escalates to `FATAL Error: …`~~ **3 files FIXED 2026-06-10 — the FATAL is byte-identical to native; the runner's INTERNAL/fatal pre-check fired before expected-error matching.** `wal_promote_version` root-caused: `host_fs.cpp` drops `FILE_FLAGS_APPEND`, WAL appends overwrite offset 0 on re-attach (fix pending wasm rebuild). | runner + host-FS C++ | `test/sql/storage/checkpoint/test_checkpoint_failure_on_detach.test` |
| O | ICU statically built in | 2 | These tests assume a build *without* ICU ("Setting has no effect when ICU is not loaded"); our build links ICU in, so TIMESTAMPTZ casts behave like upstream-with-ICU and the no-ICU expectations fail. | wontfix | `test/sql/timezone/disable_timestamptz_casts.test` |
| P | Runner limitations | 16 | (a) 14 files: upstream expected blocks contain alignment/trailing tabs (`Bob\t\t6.5`, `2\t12\t`); the runner splits strictly on single tabs → "expected row has N tab-separated values". (b) 2 files: multi-variable `foreach type,min,max …` is not parsed, so `${type}` reaches the parser. | runner | `test/sql/aggregate/aggregates/test_weighted_avg.test` |
| Q | RNG sequence parity | 2 | After `set seed`, `random()`/`USING SAMPLE` do not reproduce DuckDB's pcg sequence (and window sharing of volatile expressions evaluates in a different order). | engine | `test/sql/function/numeric/set_seed_for_sample.test` |
| R | Deep-semantics singles | 15 | One-off engine behaviors — itemized below. | mixed | `test/sql/join/iejoin/iejoin_projection_maps.test` |
| S | String compression codec selection | 6 | VARCHAR/BLOB segments checkpoint as `uncompressed`; `dict_fsst` is never selected, so `pragma_storage_info` checks fail (data itself round-trips correctly — every failure is the codec-name probe). | engine | `test/sql/storage/compression/string/simple.test` |
| | **Total** | **224** | | | |

### R — deep-semantics singles, itemized

| File | Root cause | Fixability |
|------|------------|------------|
| `test/sql/join/iejoin/iejoin_projection_maps.test` | ~~Correctness bug: IEJoin returns wrong aggregate~~ **FIXED 2026-06-10 — was the runner dropping `set seed` (unseeded `random()` data), not IEJoin.** See the `set seed` fix note above. | runner |
| `test/sql/optimizer/predicate_factoring.test` | **Correctness bug**: factoring `(a=1 AND b>3) OR (a=1 AND c<5)` yields `NULL` where DuckDB yields `false`. | engine |
| `test/sql/aggregate/aggregates/test_quantile_disc.test` | `quantile_disc`/`percentile_disc` with `ORDER BY … DESC` modifier: DuckDB returns its descending-interval result (`1.2`), ours returns the plain discrete element (`1`). | engine |
| `test/sql/function/operator/test_in_empty_table.test` | ~~`int_col IN ('a','b','c','d','e')` (≥5 elements) errors~~ **FIXED 2026-06-10 — exhost catch-all/typed-clause id collision broke the binder's try-cast catch(...) fallback; see the class J fix.** | exhost |
| `test/sql/optimizer/test_in_rewrite_rule.test` | ~~Same IN-list VARCHAR-fallback gap~~ **FIXED 2026-06-10 — same exhost catch-dispatch fix.** | exhost |
| `test/sql/types/numeric/uhugeint_try_cast.test` | `UHUGEINT_MAX::FLOAT` → `inf` (cast bug; should be ≈3.4e38). | engine |
| `test/sql/sample/test_sample_too_big.test` | `TABLESAMPLE RESERVOIR(1000000000)` allocates the full reservoir up front → "Out of Memory Error: Allocation failure"; DuckDB clamps to input size. | engine |
| `test/sql/json/issues/read_json_memory_usage.test` | Opposite memory problem: `SET memory_limit='50MiB'` is not enforced — the read *succeeds* where DuckDB raises Out of Memory. | engine |
| `test/sql/function/generic/test_sleep.test` | `sleep_ms` raises "requires DuckDB to be compiled with thread support" — single-threaded wasm build. | wasm-rebuild / wontfix |
| `test/sql/catalog/view/test_loosely_qualified_view_sql.test` | View SQL is not re-qualified against the view's own database/schema when read via `db1.v1` from another catalog. | engine |
| `test/sql/types/type/test_make_get_type.test` | `get_type(NULL)` returns SQL NULL instead of JSON `"NULL"`. | engine |
| `test/sql/copy/csv/test_timestamptz_12926.test` | CSV reader with `dtypes=[TIMESTAMPTZ]` accepts `1/1/2020` (sniffer date format applied) where DuckDB requires a strict TIMESTAMPTZ cast and errors. | engine |
| `test/sql/limit/test_batch_limit_filters.test` | EXPLAIN plan-shape: we keep `STREAMING_LIMIT` where upstream's batched path avoids it. | engine / wontfix |
| `test/sql/json/test_json_serialize_plan.test` | `json_serialize_plan` output schema differs from upstream's (`LOGICAL_PROJECTION`/`LOGICAL_GET` names absent). | engine / wontfix |
| `test/sql/pragma/profiling/test_custom_profiling_optimizer_settings.test` | Custom profiling metrics for optimizer phases (`optimizer_join_order`) are never > 0. | engine |

## Cross-cutting notes (not counted above)

- **Dangling transaction after failed statements.** The engine/driver leaves an
  open transaction after any failed statement; the very next statement on that
  connection fails with "cannot start a transaction within a transaction". The
  runner absorbs this with a sacrificial `ROLLBACK` after every expected error
  outside explicit `BEGIN` (6,017 issued per corpus run). Without that
  workaround, hundreds of additional files would fail. Fix belongs in the
  driver/engine autocommit path; bucket I is the visible remnant of the same
  area inside explicit transactions.
- **Multi-statement records** (`BEGIN; stmt; stmt`) are split on `;` by the
  runner before execution, because the driver cannot prepare multiple
  statements at once (the same restriction behind bucket H). Statement-level
  behavior is therefore measured, but true single-round-trip multi-statement
  semantics are not.
- **789 skips** are unsupported test *directives*, not engine failures:
  `load` (persistent-db restart protocol, 386), `require parquet` (224),
  `require autocomplete` (79), `require tpch/tpcds` (34), `require httpfs`
  (19), `concurrentloop` (15), and a long tail. They overstate nothing about
  engine quality but should not be forgotten: parquet is the largest
  feature-shaped hole in the corpus.

## Flaky under parallel load (`-j 4`), not in the canonical 224

| File | Symptom |
|------|---------|
| `test/sql/index/art/nodes/test_art_prefix_transform_deprecated_create.test` | exceeded the 30 s/file timeout under load; passes in the baseline run |
| `test/sql/join/iejoin/test_iejoin_events.test` | ~~nondeterministic wrong COUNT (`6` vs `2`)~~ **FIXED 2026-06-10** — runner dropped `set seed`, so the COUNT was over unseeded random data and "passed" only when it landed on the expected value by luck. Not an IEJoin bug. |
